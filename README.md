Multipass /K3s  Kubernetes cluster deployment 



To create a node named master, run the following multipass launch command and pass it the following flags:
* -c with the number of CPUs to allocate (1)
* -m with the amount of memory to allocate (1G). Note that you can use the following suffixes: K, M, and G
* -d with the disk space to allocate (4G). Similarly, note that you can use the following suffixes: K, M, and G
* -n with the name of the node (master)
* The name of the image (18.04)
* Nc -v host port 

Netcat (nc) command is a command-line utility for reading and writing data between two computer networks. The communication happens using either TCP or UDP.

# Launching multipass  infrastructure

multipass launch -c 4 -m 4G -d 20G -n k3s-worker-1 20.04
multipass launch -c 4 -m 4G -d 20G -n k3s-worker-2 20.04

# Deploy K3s using multipass exec command to k3s-master node
 multipass exec k3s-master -- bash -c "curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -"

# Command to store the content of this file into an environment variable called TOKEN:

# command to save the IP of the master node into an environment variable named IP
multipass info k3s-master | grep IPv4 | awk '{print $2}'

# command uses  multipass to integrate another worker node in the k3s master cluster  using the TOKEN and IP environment variables

sudo k3s kubectl get pods

Clean up your cluster
1. Open a new terminal window (on the host), and then use the multipass stop command to stop your nodes: multipass stop k3s-master k3s-worker-1 k3s-worker-2
2. Delete your instances with multipass delete k3s-master k3s-worker-1 k3s-worker-2
3. Permanently delete your instances by entering: multipass purge
4. Use the multipass list command to verify that the instances were deleted:  multipass list
5.  No instances foundâ€¨
